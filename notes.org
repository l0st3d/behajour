* Rational
 - I want to learn clojure
   - specifically macros
 - I'm used to writing tests in a Given, when, then style, with the reuse available with JBehave
 - Saw http://code.google.com/p/conducta/ and thought it could be done better, so I gave it a go ...

* Features
 - defstep function that defines each step, and how it gets data
 - scenario macro that defines each test
   - integrates with test-is - each scenario is a test-is test
